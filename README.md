**Abstract**
Linear Discriminant Analysis and Principal Component Analysis are well known linear  transformation techniques that have been applied to facial recognition for many decades. In this paper, both PCA and LDA are applied to a combination of “The ORL Database of Faces” and photos of our own faces. Using PCA alone, we were able to achieve a facial recognition rate of 95.23%. LDA was also able to achieve a 95.23% facial recognition rate on our test data.
